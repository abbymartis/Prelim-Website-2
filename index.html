<h1>CTiS: Impact of Technology </h1>

</ul>
<p>Social media has rapidly evolved from basic communication tools to complex platforms like Facebook, 
  Instagram, and Twitter, enabling users to connect, share, and engage in multiple activities. 
  However, this digital transformation has also given rise to new forms of cybercrime. Among the most concerning is 
  identity theft, which has significantly increased due to the accessibility of personal information online. 
  Social media platforms, rich with personal data, have become prime targets for identity thieves who exploit 
  publicly shared content for financial or fraudulent gain. 

<br>
<br>

Identity theft involves the unauthorized use of personal information—such as credit card numbers or social security 
details—to impersonate someone else. Traditionally, this crime was committed through physical means like rummaging 
through trash for documents or stealing wallets. Today, however, it largely occurs online, with criminals using 
personal data gathered from social media profiles. In some cases, offenders even publicize their crimes, giving 
rise to what are now called “performance crimes.” 

<br>
<br>

Closely related to identity theft is phishing—the act of tricking users into revealing sensitive information 
through fake messages or websites. Social media platforms, particularly Instagram, have become popular targets 
for phishing attacks because of their large user bases and the casual, fast-paced nature of communication. 
Attackers often impersonate trusted contacts or brands to deceive users into clicking malicious links or providing 
login credentials. The social and interactive design of these platforms makes it easier for phishing attempts to 
blend in and appear legitimate, increasing the risk of users falling victim. 

<br>
<br>

This website explores two key areas: the different types of identity theft occurring on social media, 
and the level of user awareness about its risks and prevention. While some users find phishing education helpful, 
many cite barriers such as time constraints and unengaging training formats.
