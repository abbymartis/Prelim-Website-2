<h1>Project Technology/Topic Proposal</h1>

<p>This is the first stage of your team project, where you propose the chosen technology/topic which you will investigate.  
	This will then be approved or reviewed.</p>

		<td> <em>Our project focuses on phishing scams on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn, which are commonly used by cybercriminals to carry out identity theft. These scams often involve fake profiles, cloned accounts, or deceptive links designed to trick users into revealing sensitive data such as passwords, financial information, or personal details. The importance of this issue lies in the serious consequences of identity theft, which can result in financial fraud, emotional distress, and reputational damage. Our aim is to raise awareness of these threats and explore a range of prevention strategies. We focus on user education, platform security tools, and the use of AI-based detection systems to identify and mitigate scams. This topic is highly relevant due to the widespread use of social media, particularly among younger users who may be more vulnerable to online deception. Phishing attacks are becoming increasingly personal and believable, making them a critical concern in the field of modern cybersecurity. We chose this topic because social media represents a growing attack surface for cybercriminals, and many users still lack awareness of how phishing works. By combining insights into human behaviour with technical solutions, our project has the potential to propose real, effective, and technology-driven preventive measures (Baecker, 2019).</em></td>
