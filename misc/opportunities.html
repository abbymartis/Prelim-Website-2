<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>

<p>The advent of social networking sites has made information and communication a part of everyday life. 
  All this has made them vulnerable targets for malicious activities on the web, rather obviously identity 
  theft and fraudulent phishing attacks. The solution to all this lies in a multi-pronged attack from technical 
  advancements, educating the user level, and concerted action (Ahmed, Shahria, & Uddin, 2020). </p>

<p>One key area of opportunity is utilizing image-based identity verification systems. Ahmed, Shahria and Uddin (2020) 
  suggest an "Image-Based Identity Theft Prevention" framework where a profile image is uploaded on account setup. 
  The image will be cross-checked against existing profiles to identify and prevent duplicate or fraudulent accounts. 
  This can dissuade the impersonation of profiles by cybercriminals through stolen images, hence lessening impersonation-related 
  issues.</p>

<p>Improving user awareness and education is another important area. Many users unintentionally share 
  their own information and become vulnerable to attacks from phishing. According to Ahmed, Shahria and Uddin (2020), 
  educating them on the risks of oversharing as well as on the symptoms of a phishing attack will encourage them to 
  better secure their information. A good example includes being mindful of unsolicited requests for personal 
  information or inviting them to follow carefully crafted malicious links. By creating a culture of vigilance, 
  the users become active protectors of their own security. </p>

<p>The platforms themselves can also enhance security through the deployment of sophisticated 
  algorithms for detection. These algorithms can track user behaviour for inconsistencies, like sudden friend 
  requests or messages with embedded phishing links. As noted by Ahmed, Shahria and Uddin (2020), through 
  flagging and detection of abnormal behaviour, platforms can act against threats beforehand before they 
  affect users. Multi-factor authentication also provides an added layer of security as it makes unwanted 
  access by cybercriminals harder to achieve.</p>

<p>Fostering good sharing habits among consumers is also crucial. Users can be encouraged to 
  limit who can see their birthdates and their own contact information to lower their risk level. 
  Sites can help by providing default settings on what not to share publicly and who not to share it with. 
  Educating consumers about changing those settings keeps them in charge of the information about 
  themselves(Ahmed, Shahria, & Uddin, 2020). Finally, cooperation between social media companies, 
  law enforcement officials, and cybersecurity professionals can advance threat response. According 
  to Ahmed, Shahria and Uddin (2020), through collaboration on threat intelligence and best practices, 
  the involved parties can create holistic solutions to link identity theft and phishing attacks. 
  Partnerships can also result in the quick detection and remediation of malicious actors and assist 
  in a safer digital space for everyone.</p>

<p>Finally, although social networking sites provide unprecedented connectivity, they also 
  open doors for cyber-attacks. Through the application of technical solutions such as image-based 
  verification, improving education for users, reinforcement of platform security, achieving responsible 
  sharing, and facilitation of multi-stakeholder collaboration, it's possible to efficiently counter the 
  threat of identity theft and phishing frauds. Active steps and collaborative action can be necessary 
  in protecting the user in this digital era we live in(Ahmed, Shahria, & Uddin, 2020).</p>
