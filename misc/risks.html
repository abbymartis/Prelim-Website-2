<h1>Technology Risks</h1>

<p>With the advancement of technology, social media platforms have weaved themselves into the fabric of 
  daily living, providing new avenues for entertainment, communication, and sharing vital information. 
  Cybercriminals who engage in identity deception, phishing schemes, and other forms of online frauds 
  also find social networks to be particularly appealing targets. The threat remains progressively sophisticated, 
  and users become increasingly vulnerable in the face of considerable personal and monetary risks. Studies 
  indicate the necessity for both awareness and education as means of lessening the susceptibility of the user 
  from such frauds (Mouncey & Ciobotaru, 2025). </p>

<p>One of the most serious issues on social networking sites is identity theft, whereby malicious 
  individuals hack and take personal data about a person and pretend to be the person themselves. 
  Social networking customers share sensitive information like birthdates, whereabouts, and who they are 
  related to without realizing they are providing attackers with crucial information used to guess passwords 
  or answer security queries. Fake accounts and impersonation additionally complicate the matter on top of this, 
  making scammers post whatever they desire from a victimâ€™s network. Malicious third-party apps and quizzes asking 
  customers for data access and harvesting it for fraudulent activity also present a rising threat.</p>

<p>Phishing scams on social networking sites also abound. Attackers also use misleading messages, 
  imitation brand pages, or bogus giveaways as a way of luring victims into clicking on malicious links or 
  divulging sensitive information. As stated by  Mouncey and Ciobotaru (2025), social media apps like Instagram 
  become targeted as well for the scams. Phishing messages also look legitimate and originate from trusted sources 
  like known friends or recognized brands. The moment a user falls for the scam, their account might be compromised 
  and used for further propagation of the attack and thus enhance both the attack's coverage and total effect.</p>

<p>One of the key reasons why phishing scams succeed is simply the general unawareness of the average user. 
  Mouncey and Ciobotaru (2025) established that most users lack the understanding of what constitutes or 
  how they should manage a phishing attack. Even where there is available cyber awareness training, it may 
  be hampered by time issues, lack of interest, or feelings of irrelevance. This underlines the necessity 
  for better interactive and accessible educational methods.</p>

<p>These challenges can be mitigated by several strategies proposed by Mouncey and Ciobotaru (2025).
  A good approach is employing digital nudges and micro-modules of training which present brief and 
  specific cybersecurity advice when individuals make normal usage of social media use. Bite-sized interventions 
  tend to be learned and utilized by the individuals better than dense advice. The study also recommends imposing 
  mandatory cybersecurity training programs in schools, workplaces as well as government institutions. 
  By institutionalizing cybersecurity awareness and making the training interactive, the individuals are 
  better prepared to identify and resist the threat posed by phishing attacks.</p>

<p>Furthermore, identity theft and phishing attacks on social media present serious digital challenges 
  in our interconnected society. Because cybercriminals evolve and change continually, so must the educational 
  efforts at prevention. Building awareness through interactive and accessible training can minimize susceptibility 
  and safeguard personal data. Eventually, every effort at developing a culture of digital responsibility will be 
  necessary to sustain security within the ever-changing platform of social media.</p>
